## About Me
I am an Industrial Engineer with over 4 years of experience in Python. Throughout my career, I have developed a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analysis, and I love working with technology to create solutions that can make a difference.

My passion for AI has led me to explore the field of Deep Learning, where I have gained expertise in developing and implementing neural network architectures for various applications such as image classification and natural language processing. I am always eager to learn about new developments in this field and to experiment with cutting-edge techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of my models.

Aside from Deep Learning, I also have experience in Automation and Data Analysis. I have developed automated scripts for tasks such as data cleaning and processing, as well as data visualization tools to help companies make informed decisions based on their data. I am proficient in Python and its libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
